# Thermostat

In this implementation of the Makers Academy Week 5 Thermostat Challenge the user clicks a button to increase/decrease the temperature by a degree at a time.  
The user can enter their current city in and the openweathermap API will return the outside temperature and weather conditions.

* Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
* You can increase/decrease the temperature by a degree at a time
* The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
* If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
* If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
* Power saving mode is on by default
* You can reset the temperature to 20째 with the reset button
* The thermostat displays its current energy usage:  
< 18째 is low-usage  
< 25째 is medium-usage  
\>= 25째 is high-usage.
